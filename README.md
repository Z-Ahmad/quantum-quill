# Quantum Quill

Quantum Quill is an innovative project that combines artistry and artificial intelligence to empower users to create haikus with the assistance of advanced language models. This web application provides a user-friendly interface for composing haikus with real-time AI-generated suggestions.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of Quantum Quill is to develop a unique platform that makes it effortless for users to unleash their creativity by composing haikus. The application lends a helping hand by suggesting the *initial* line of their haiku, fostering artistic expression without overpowering it. My aim is to assist users in their artistic endeavors, helping them express themselves in ways they might have found challenging before.

## Features
